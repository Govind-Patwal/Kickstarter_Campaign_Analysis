# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
This is a Module 1 challange as part of my 'Data Analytics and Visualization Bootcamp' course from Univeristy of Toronto.

In this challange, I have been assigned to help Louise kickstart her production.

### Purpose
Louise is an up-and-coming playwrigth Louise, who wants to start a crowdfunding campaign to fund her play 'Fever' in the U.S. and is hestitant in jumping in her first fundraising campaign. 

I have to use Excel to organize, sort and analyze crowfunding data to determine whether there are specific factoss that make a campaign succesful. These insights will help Louise plan her own and set it up for success. 

The reports, charts and findings that I share with her will help her gain a greater understanding of campaigns from start to finish and will help her mirror successul ones in the same category. 
## Analysis and Challenges

### Past Analysis 
The analysis that I shared with her earlier showed that the category 'Theatre' was the most frequent item in Kickstarters (almost 2x as frequent as the 2nd most frequent item 'Music'). 

In the category 'Theater', the most popular subcategory was 'Plays (almost 9x more popular than the 2 other subcategories ''Muscial and 'Spaces'). 

Descriptive stastics of Successful and Failed U.S. kickstarters reealed that the mean of each distribution was around the 3rd quartile, so the data followed similar distributions in each subset. 

Based on her interest in researching musicals in Great Britain for a future project, I created a 'Box and Whiskers Plot' for her. It showed us that the mean of the campaign goal is approx. £4,000. This is outside of the range of outliers for the pledged amounts, so Louise should probably try to get her play produced for less than £4,000. Half of the campaign goals are less than £2,000, which is just over the 3rd quartile for amounts pledged. So £2,000 might be a better goal to consider.

### New Analysis (for Challange 1)
I then decided to give her further insignts by digging deeper and performing an analysis based on two important factors
1) Outcomes based on Launch date 
2) Outcomes Based on Goals. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
This Analysis made us discover the following

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
This Analysis made us discover the following

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

On the part 2 of the assignment 'Analysis based on Goals'. I missed reading the instrucion # 3 completely (I missed the part "on the “Subcategory” column using “plays” as the criteria."). My graph was coming totally different. I spent 3 hours and still the graphs were not matching. I decided to go back to the instructions, filtered "Subcategory" using "plays" and the graph corrected to the desired graph.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

This Analysis made us discover two important factors that can make or break the success of her campaign.
1) The best month to launch a campaign is May, this is follwed by June.
2) The worst month to launch a campaign is December. Jan, Mar, Apr and Nov are not good months either.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

We can conclude that
1) The Goal with the most success rate is Less than 1,000: Success rate 76%, followed closely by the 1,000-5,000 goal, with a success rate of 73%
2) As the Goal is incresed the success rate usually decreases, however, surprisingly the goal of 35,000 - 45,000 has a success rate of 67%

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

Some limitations are
1) The data is old. Louise came to me in January 2020 for help. The data that I have is from 2014-2016. The more recent data I have, the better is the analysis thus the better the result.
2) It does not have data for unexpected situations like the COVID pandemic. In a unexceptional situation like this, I would not suggest Louise to start a campaign in June/July this year.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

Some othe things that we could have done

1) In the analysis of 'Theater Outcomes based on Launch Date', we are using the count of successful, failed and canceled campaigns. We could use percentage insted. 
2) Since Louise is interested in Plays, we could futher create a chart that show 'Theater plays based on Launch Date'
3) We could do an analysis based on the length of campaigns
